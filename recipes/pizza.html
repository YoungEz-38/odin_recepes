    <h1>The ingredients:</h1>
    <ul>
        <Li> 1 teaspoon active dry yeast</Li>
        <Li> 2/3 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</Li>
        <Li> 2 cups all-purpose flour</Li>
        <Li> 1 teaspoon salt</Li>
        <Li>2 tablespoons olive oil</Li>
        <Li> 1 (10 ounce) can tomato sauce</Li>
        <Li>1 pound shredded mozzarella cheese</Li>
        <Li>1/2 cup grated Romano cheese</Li>
        <li>1/4 up chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>The Process:</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Sprinkle yeast over surface of warm water in a large bowl. Let stand for 1 minute, then stir to dissolve. Mix in flour, salt, and olive oil. When dough is too thick to stir, turn out onto a floured surface and knead for 5 minutes. Knead in a little more flour if dough is too sticky. Place into an oiled bowl, cover, and set aside in a warm place to rise until doubled in bulk. </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). If using a pizza stone, preheat it in the oven as well, setting it on the lowest shelf.</li>
        <li>When dough has risen, flatten it out on a lightly floured surface. Roll or stretch out into a 12-inch circle, and place on a baking pan. If you are using a pizza stone, you may place it on a piece of parchment while preheating the stone in the oven.</li>
        <li>Spread tomato sauce evenly over dough. Sprinkle with oregano, mozzarella cheese, basil, Romano cheese, and red pepper flakes.</li>
        <li>Bake for 12 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until bottom of crust is browned when you lift up the edge a little, and cheese is melted and bubbly. Cool for about 5 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
